# TwilioNotifier
Wrote a script that periodically checked our university website for any changes. This was when our results were delayed indefinitely and I hated the feeling of anxiety and nervousness that accompanied checking the website every single day.

This script checks the website for any changes, and if results are posted for my department it notifies me by sending a text message on my phone.
